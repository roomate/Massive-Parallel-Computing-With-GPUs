# Massive Parallel Computing with GPUs

This project investigates GPU-accelerated stochastic and PDE-based methods for high-dimensional option pricing, focusing on computational trade-offs between Monte Carlo and finite-difference solvers.

This repository follows the course [Massive Parallel Computing with GPUs](https://finance.math.upmc.fr/enseignements/2_mn_4_massive_parallel/) given at Sorbonne University between February and March 2026.

## Project *PDE Simulation of Bullet Option*

### Context

The project aims to utilise **the parallelisation capabilities of GPUs to price bullet options**, which are exotic, path-dependent contracts. Due to the highly constrained nature of option values, computing precise estimates demands high computational power, which is where GPUs come in. This is a scientifically challenging and relevant project demanding:

- The ability to write complex algorithms in the C programming language.
- Design and implement a parallelisation strategy that leverages GPU hardware.
- Leveraging low-level asynchronous interactions between the host and device with the CUDA runtime API.
- Assess the quality of a stochastic and deterministic methods.

### Algorithms

Two numerical solutions are proposed:

- Monte-Carlo algorithm. The device grid parallelises a large number of asset price trajectories and combines them to provide an option price Monte-Carlo estimator.

- The finite-difference scheme. The Black-Scholes partial differential equation (i.e. a backward Fokker–Planck equation) is solved using a Crank–Nicolson finite-difference scheme that leverages the Parallel Cyclic Reduction algorithm for efficient implementation.

The GPU timer, more precise and trustworthy than the CPU timer, measures the execution time. Both yield a solution within a comparable time frame of around a second.


### Visualization

To visualize the price surface plot computed with Monte-Carlo method, you first need to run:
```
#Run the compilation routine
make

# Run Monte-Carlo algorithm
./MC 3 <filename.txt>
```

You should see a text file appearing in the working directory. Eventually, run with your Python interpreter
```
python plot.py <filename.txt>
```

to plot a surface of the option price against its two conditioning parameters. You can tune the time instant with the vertical slider on the left.

### Speed-up

The table below compares the running times of the PDE- and Monte Carlo-based approaches for different parameter values. Interestingly, a warm-up effect appears to occur. Running a kernel $n$ times within a loop is faster than running the program from start $n$ times.

#### Monte-Carlo

| $T_i$     | No reduction  |  Reduction w/ registers | Reduction w/ shared memory |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :---: |          ---: |
| 0.01   | 0.0014 ± 0.0445 | 0.0014 ± 0.0430| 0.0013 ± 0.0412|
| 0.30   | 0.0015 ± 0.0460 | 0.0014 ± 0.0429| 0.0014 ± 0.0441|
| 0.60   | 0.0014 ± 0.0449 | 0.0013 ± 0.0418| 0.0013 ± 0.0418|
| 0.90   | 0.0014 ± 0.0443 | 0.0013 ± 0.0425| 0.0013 ± 0.0417|
| 1.0   | 0.0014 ± 0.0437 | 0.0014 ± 0.0447| 0.0013 ± 0.0426|

This table shows the execution times for estimating a single scalar $F(T_i, x, j)$ using the Monte-Carlo method. Three variants are compared: no reduction (`MC_k1`), thread reduction with shared memory (`MC_k2`)and thread reduction with registers (`MC_k3`).
$128$ blocks and $512$ threads per block execute the calculations in parallel.

We solve the PDE over the grid using routine `MC_k4`. The threads are reduced on registers, and each grid node uses $512 \times W$ threads, where $W=128$ and $W=256$ on the left and right table, respectively.

<table>
<tr><td>

|N | Execution time (ms)|
|--|--|
|128| 2797|
|256| 5596|
|512| 10668|
|1024| 21463|

</td><td>

|N | Execution time (ms)|
|--|--|
|128| 5533|
|256| 11097|
|512| 22781|
|1024| 48128|

</td></tr> </table>

The parameter $N$ tunes the coarseness of the grid. There is a clear linear relationship between the computational load and the execution time.

#### Finite difference
The finite difference schema splits the time interval $[0, 1]$ into $N_t$ points.

| $N_t$     | ms  |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| 0.01   | 0.56 |
| 0.30   | 1.22 |
| 0.60   | 1.57 |
| 0.90   | 6.02 |
| 1.0   | 12.26 |

This table shows the execution time to compute the evolution of $F$ during a single time step with a finite difference schema.
$128$ blocks and $512$ threads per block execute the calculations in parallel.

## Labs
The course involves a number of labs that students can attend to put into practice the ideas that have been talked about in class.

- Lab1: *Device Query*. This lab teaches how to query the device to get the piece of information you need on your GPU.
- Lab2: *Hello World!* This lab is your first step in the world of CUDA programming. Say your very first words through your device's processor.
- Lab3: *Add Array*. Add two arrays on you device, and clock the execution time with the CPU and GPU timer. *The Need for Speed!*
- Lab4: *Monte-Carlo*. Use your favourite Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) and compute expectations at light speed. Ideal to beat the financial markets. You can compute the arithmetic mean either:
    * on the host. It does not exploit the GPU's full power.
    * on-device. A code implementing Dyadic thread reduction using shared memory on the kernel is proposed.
- Lab5: *Partial Differential Equation*. Solve the backward Fokker–Planck equation using three different approaches with a finite-difference schemes. To a greater or lesser extent, each approach leverages the capabilities of the device in a different way.
    * Explicit Euler scheme.
    * Implicit Euler scheme with Thomas' method to solve the tridiagonal system. Despite simple, the main bottleneck is that it cannot be efficiently parallelised on GPUs.
    * Crank-Nicolson scheme, aka semi-implicit semi-explicit for better stability properties. Parallel-Cyclic Reduction algorithm is implemented to solve the resulting tridiagonal system. Although this algorithm is more complex, it lends itself much more naturally to parallelisation on GPU grids.
